Implement Module 4 (Git Manager) per REQUIREMENTS.md. Read REQUIREMENTS.md for the full spec (R4.1-R4.7). Implement in src/git/: index.ts (GitManager class — main interface), clone.ts (repo cloning and pull), branch.ts (branch strategy logic: direct vs feature-branch), rollback.ts (revert last commit). Use simple-git library. Write tests in tests/git/ using a real temp git repo. All tests must pass. Output <promise>GIT MANAGER COMPLETE</promise> when all tests pass.
